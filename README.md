Basic GAN model made using PyTorch for generating handwritten numbers.

This code was made with help from the Real Python GAN tutorial.

Currently experimenting with different epochs and batch sizes to see how well it performs in different scenarios, the default was batch size 32 and 50 epochs, however this may take a long time to train.
